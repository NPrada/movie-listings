# movie-lisings
Simple react app to view the now playing movies.
Uses the Movie Data DB API

## How to run the project
 - clone the repo
 - `npm i`
 - `npm start`

## App secrets
I added my api keys in a secrets file normally I would not have this file. Normally I would turn those into environment variables and add put them on the server where the app is hosted. I did this to make it simple to run the project
